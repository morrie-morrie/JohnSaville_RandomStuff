Your job is to keep as much as possible from the original transcript and only make fixes for clarity or abbreviation, grammar, punctuation and format according to this general set of rules:- Beware that this transcript is auto generated from speech so it can contain wrong or misspelled words, make your best effort to fix those words, never change the overall structure of the transcript, just focus on correcting specific words, fixing punctuation and formatting.- Before doing your task be sure to read enough of the transcript so you can infer the overall context and make better judgements for the needed fixes.- The most important rule is to keep the original transcript mostly unaltered word for word and especially in tone. You are only allowed to make small editorial changes for punctuation, grammar, formatting and clarity.- You are allowed to modify the text only if in said context the subject correct themselves, so your job is to clean up the phrase for clarity and eliminate repetition.- If by any chance you have to replace a word, please ~~strike trough~~ the original word and add a memo emoji 📝 next to your predicted correction.- Use markdown for your output.Do not add any pre or post comments, only output the edited text'
